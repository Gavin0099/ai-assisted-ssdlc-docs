# AI Governance Update Protocol

Status: extracted from AGENTS.md
Semantic change: no
Runtime behavior change: no
Enforcement change: no

## Purpose

This protocol distinguishes AI Governance check/update intent from ordinary
instruction-file synchronization.

Do not treat `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS.base.md`, or local governance instruction-file
sync as proof that the AI Governance Framework itself is current.

For the map of where update and review instructions reach different agent
surfaces, see `docs/governance/agent-instruction-surface-map.md`.

## Update Intent Rule

When the user asks to "Update AI Governance to latest" or equivalent Chinese
update wording, first determine whether the repository consumes AI Governance
through a registered submodule. Common paths include:
- `ai-governance-framework`
- `.ai-governance-framework`

Repos may also use a repo-specific path such as
`external/ai-governance-framework`; the updater should discover these through
`.gitmodules` entries whose URL points at an `ai-governance-framework`
repository.

If a governance submodule exists, the request maps to the governed submodule
update workflow. Compare the nested governance HEAD with the approved target
upstream HEAD, preferably through the governed submodule updater dry-run path.

Do not claim AI Governance is already current based only on:
- `AGENTS.md` unchanged
- `AGENTS.base.md` unchanged
- parent repository `HEAD == origin/main`
- `git pull --ff-only` reporting already up to date
- clean parent repository working tree

## Valid Already-Current Evidence

A valid `already_current` conclusion for a submodule consumer must include:
- governance submodule path
- nested governance HEAD
- target upstream framework HEAD
- dry-run update result

Required response shape:

```text
AI Governance update check: <already_current | update_available | updated | manual_update | destructive_manual_update | not_submodule_consumer | not_verified>
ai_governance_update_result: REPORTED | NOT REPORTED
governance submodule path: <path | NOT FOUND | NOT CHECKED>
nested governance HEAD: <sha | NOT CHECKED>
target framework HEAD: <sha | NOT CHECKED>
dry-run: PASS | FAIL | NOT RUN
update mode: already_current | fast_forward | detached_target_checkout | NOT CLAIMED
parent repo commit: <hash | NOT NEEDED | NOT CREATED>
governance maturity summary: RUN | NOT RUN | NOT AVAILABLE
user-facing adoption status: <minimal | partial | full_candidate | not_governed | unknown | NOT REPORTED>
framework topology: <copy_based | repo_owned_framework_path | submodule_consumer | unknown | NOT REPORTED>
static self-contained: yes | no | unknown | NOT REPORTED
runtime capable: not_checked | <other explicit value | NOT REPORTED>
hook framework root: inside_repo | external | absent | unknown | NOT REPORTED
framework pin freshness: <current_vs_local_tracking | behind_local_tracking | ahead_or_diverged_vs_local_tracking | unknown | not_applicable | NOT REPORTED>
repo-specific rules: true | false | NOT REPORTED
domain contract: true | false | NOT REPORTED
validator surface: true | false | not_checked | NOT REPORTED
memory workflow surface: <value from summary | NOT REPORTED>
adoption cannot claim: <short cannot-claim list from the summary | NOT REPORTED>
human_readable_adoption_summary: REPORTED | NOT REPORTED
```

If the session only updates instruction files, report that as an
instruction-file update and mark the AI Governance Framework update as
`not_verified`.

Invalid conclusion:

```text
AGENTS.md was updated and the parent repo is up to date, so AI Governance is current.
```

Valid partial conclusion:

```text
AGENTS.md was updated, but the AI Governance Framework submodule was not checked.
AI Governance update check: not_verified
governance submodule path: NOT CHECKED
nested governance HEAD: NOT CHECKED
target framework HEAD: NOT CHECKED
dry-run: NOT RUN
update mode: NOT CLAIMED
parent repo commit: NOT CREATED
governance maturity summary: NOT RUN
user-facing adoption status: NOT REPORTED
human_readable_adoption_summary: NOT REPORTED
```

## Check Vs Update Intent

Classify the user's wording before acting.

Check intent examples:
- "檢查 AI Governance 是否最新"
- "確認 AI Governance 有沒有更新"
- "verify AI Governance version"
- "check whether AI Governance is up to date"

Action: verify only. Do not update the submodule pointer.

Update intent examples:
- "幫我更新最新版 AI Governance"
- "把 AI Governance 更新到最新"
- "更新 AI Governance 到最新版"
- "Update AI Governance to latest"

Action: perform the governed update flow for a submodule consumer: detect the
governance submodule path, run dry-run, then apply the scoped submodule pointer
update if dry-run is safe and no blocker exists.

For update intent, do not stop after direct HEAD comparison when nested
governance HEAD differs from target framework HEAD. A direct HEAD comparison
may establish `update_available`, but it is not a completed update.

If the repository is a submodule consumer and no blocker exists, continue from
`update_available` to the governed update step.

Ask for confirmation only when the user intent is ambiguous or when a blocker
requires a user decision.

## Fixed Status Values

AI Governance update status must use one of these fixed values:
- `already_current`: nested governance HEAD already matches target framework HEAD.
- `update_available`: nested governance HEAD differs from target framework HEAD, but update has not yet been applied.
- `updated`: governed update flow completed and nested governance HEAD now matches target framework HEAD.
- `manual_update`: the agent changed a governance submodule pointer, gitlink,
  framework checkout, or lock file without governed updater/F-7 evidence. This
  may report what changed, but must not accompany `already_current`,
  `updated`, `completed`, `latest`, or full-adoption claims.
- `destructive_manual_update`: a `manual_update` path that discarded local
  framework checkout state, such as nested worktree changes or untracked files.
  The final report must list the discarded modified and untracked paths.
- `blocked`: update could not proceed due to dirty worktree, staged changes, dirty nested submodule, dry-run failure, missing path, or explicit blocker.
- `not_submodule_consumer`: repository does not consume AI Governance through a submodule.
- `not_verified`: the agent could not safely determine current or target governance state.

For update intent, `update_available` is an intermediate state, not a final
successful outcome. Final response must be one of:
`already_current | updated | manual_update | destructive_manual_update | blocked | not_submodule_consumer | not_verified`.

This file is the canonical source for the `manual_update` and
`destructive_manual_update` reporting vocabulary, templates, and claim
boundaries. Consumer instruction baselines and F-7 documentation may project
this vocabulary into their local execution surfaces, but must not become
independent definitions of these states.

Updating the governance submodule pointer does not automatically authorize a
parent repository commit or push unless the user explicitly requested
commit/push or the active workflow already defines commit/push as part of the
governed update task.

If no parent repo commit is created, report:

```text
parent repo commit: NOT CREATED
```

## Manual Update Reporting

Manual update paths are allowed only as an honest fallback report. They are not
evidence that the governed update flow ran.

Manual update conclusion template:

```text
AI Governance update check: manual_update
ai_governance_update_result: REPORTED
framework_update_status: manual_update
governance maturity summary: <RUN | NOT RUN | NOT AVAILABLE>
adoption_status: <from maturity summary | unknown>
human_readable_adoption_summary: <REPORTED | NOT REPORTED>
reason: governed updater/F-7 was not used
claim boundary: manual pointer/lock/checkout changes may be reported; do not claim completed/latest/full adoption
```

Destructive manual update conclusion template:

```text
AI Governance update check: destructive_manual_update
ai_governance_update_result: REPORTED
framework_update_status: destructive_manual_update
discarded_modified_paths: <list | none reported>
discarded_untracked_paths: <list | none reported>
governance maturity summary: <RUN | NOT RUN | NOT AVAILABLE>
human_readable_adoption_summary: <REPORTED | NOT REPORTED>
claim boundary: destructive local cleanup occurred; do not claim completed/latest/full adoption
```

When a manual or destructive manual path is reported, the
`ai_governance_update_result` envelope must remain a disclosure surface:

- `report_only=true`
- `framework_update_status=manual_update` or
  `framework_update_status=destructive_manual_update`
- `adoption_status=not_reported` unless `governance_maturity_summary` was
  explicitly run and relayed
- `human_readable_adoption_summary=not_reported` unless the operator-facing
  table was explicitly produced and relayed
- `cannot_claim` includes that the operation is not a completed governed
  updater/F-7 update and does not prove full adoption or enforcement

Before discarding local state in a nested framework checkout, first inspect and
record the modified and untracked paths that would be discarded. The final
operator-facing report must include that discarded-path inventory. A statement
such as "cleaned the submodule" is not a substitute for the inventory.

## Consuming Repo Reporting Corrections

When reporting AI Governance updates in a consuming repository, keep receipt
integrity, dirty-tree state, build evidence, and memory disposition separate.

### Required Adoption Status Summary

This section is the canonical reporting contract for adoption-summary relay.
Concrete tool-output projection lives in
`governance_tools/governance_update_reporting.py`. Secondary surfaces should
point here and to that projection helper instead of restating the table rows or
header.

An AI Governance update report must surface the user-facing adoption status
summary when the framework checkout contains `governance_maturity_summary`.

Do not collapse this into:
- `adoption_doctor: findings 0`;
- `governance_version_check: compatible`;
- `framework.lock.json updated`;
- `dotnet build passed`;
- `submodule updated from <old> to <new>`.

Those signals may be useful evidence, but they do not tell the operator which
governance surfaces are present.

Valid update reports must include the `governance_maturity_summary` fields, or
explicitly state why the summary was not run / not available. At minimum, report:
- user-facing adoption status and one-line meaning;
- framework topology;
- static self-contained status;
- runtime capable status;
- hook framework root;
- framework pin freshness;
- repo-specific rules;
- domain contract;
- validator surface;
- memory workflow surface;
- cannot-claim / claim-boundary summary.

When `human_readable_adoption_summary` is present, the final operator-facing
report must relay that section as a readable Chinese table, not only as
machine-readable fields. The report must include the marker
`[human_readable_adoption_summary]` and the table header:

```text
| 功能 | 狀態 | 這個功能是做什麼 |
```

It is valid to preserve the table verbatim from the tool output or to restate it
faithfully in the final report. It is not valid to report only
`user_facing_status`, `framework_topology`, or other machine field names while
omitting the Chinese feature/status/explanation table. If the table cannot be
produced or relayed, state:

```text
human_readable_adoption_summary: NOT REPORTED
reason: <why the Chinese table was not relayed>
claim boundary: machine-readable adoption fields only; operator-facing feature table was not reported
```

## Consumer Test-Quality Expectations

When an AI Governance update refreshes consumer-facing instruction surfaces,
the resulting instructions must keep test-quality expectations visible to the
agent that later writes feature or bugfix code.

For non-trivial behavior changes:

- do not report happy-path-only tests as sufficient evidence;
- reproducible bug fixes need regression tests when feasible;
- expected values must come from a specification, invariant, reviewed fixture,
  or other independent source, not copied production logic;
- mock-only assertions are weak evidence unless the test also asserts
  observable behavior, state, output, or persisted effect;
- domain validators need pass/fail fixtures, and fixture evidence is strongest
  only when a focused harness actually executes the validator against those
  fixtures.

Report-only `test_signal_quality_audit` output can help reviewers find weak
signals. It does not prove tests are industry-grade, does not prove domain
correctness, and does not create enforcement.

If the update path used a direct submodule fast-forward plus lock-file update
instead of F-7 or `adopt_governance.py`, run or relay the available
`governance_maturity_summary` before final reporting. If it cannot be run,
state:

```text
governance maturity summary: NOT RUN
reason: <why it was not run>
claim boundary: update commit/build evidence only; adoption completeness was not reported
```

Valid wording:

```text
AI Governance was updated, and the adoption status summary is partial:
framework_topology=submodule_consumer, runtime_capable=not_checked,
repo_specific_rules=false. This is report-only and does not prove runtime
enforcement or complete governance adoption.
```

Invalid wording:

```text
AI Governance was updated and adoption_doctor findings=0, so governance is
fully installed.
```

### Verified Status Claim Ceiling

Note: `not_verified` in the fixed update status list and
`repo_native_verified` in onboarding/readiness output are different axes. The
former is an update-check status; the latter is a receipt/evidence-chain
integrity signal.

`repo_native_verified`, `head_ok`, and `ts_ok` may be reported only as
receipt/evidence-chain integrity signals.

They must not be reported as proof of:
- governance enforcement;
- framework correctness;
- complete governance adoption;
- semantic correctness;
- runtime behavior correctness.

Valid wording:

```text
repo_native_verified means the closeout receipt/evidence-chain head and
timestamp alignment passed for this update check.
It does not prove governance enforcement or framework correctness.
```

Invalid wording:

```text
The repo is now governed / enforcement is active / framework correctness is verified.
```

### Dirty Tree Reporting Separation

If the consuming repository has pre-existing dirty work, the final report must
separate:
- governance apply scope;
- pre-existing user work;
- generated local artifacts or memory files;
- validation run on the combined dirty state.

Do not flatten these into a single "updated and validated" statement.

Required wording pattern when dirty work remains:

```text
Governance apply scope: <files changed by the update>
Pre-existing dirty user work: <paths or summary>
Validation scope: ran on combined dirty working tree
Overall task: NOT DONE until dirty work is audited or explicitly excluded
```

### Build And Smoke Evidence Boundary

Build or CLI smoke checks run after an AI Governance update in a dirty consuming
repo may be reported only as compatibility evidence for the current combined
dirty state.

They must not be reported as proof that:
- the governance update is correct;
- the governance framework is correct;
- governance enforcement is active;
- unrelated user feature work is complete.

### Generated Memory Disposition

Generated memory files in consuming repositories must have an explicit
disposition before the update is reported as cleanly completed.

Allowed dispositions:
- verify the file was produced by the canonical writer and commit it;
- rewrite the record through `governance_tools.memory_record` and commit it;
- explicitly mark it as unresolved dirty work.

Do not leave an untracked generated memory file as a side note while reporting
the update as complete.

## Non-Claims

This file does not change:
- updater behavior
- submodule update semantics
- hooks
- validators
- runtime behavior
- F-7 automation coverage
